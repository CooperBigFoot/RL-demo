# Issue #4: Add Unit Tests for Reservoir Environment - Implementation Plan

## Current Status

The implementation already includes comprehensive test files:
- `tests/test_reservoir_simulator.py`: Tests for the core reservoir simulator
- `tests/test_discrete_reservoir_env.py`: Tests for the TorchRL environment wrapper

## Analysis of Existing Tests

### test_reservoir_simulator.py Coverage:
✅ Initialization and parameter validation
✅ Reset functionality
✅ Water balance equation
✅ Safety constraints (release limits)
✅ Inflow generation with seasonal patterns
✅ Episode termination conditions (365 days, critical drought)
✅ Safety state checks
✅ State representation
✅ Forecast generation
✅ Full year simulation
✅ Reproducibility with seeds

### test_discrete_reservoir_env.py Coverage:
✅ Basic reset/step cycle
✅ Action constraints validation
✅ Episode termination
✅ TorchRL spec compliance
✅ Observation normalization
✅ Reward calculation
✅ Discrete action mapping
✅ Seed reproducibility

## Missing Tests and Improvements Needed

### 1. Integration Tests with TorchRL
- Test with SyncDataCollector
- Verify TensorDict format in batch scenarios
- Test with multiple parallel environments

### 2. Edge Cases for Reservoir Simulator
- Test behavior at exactly v_max capacity
- Test multiple constraint violations simultaneously
- Test extreme weather scenarios (very high/low inflows)

### 3. Additional Environment Tests
- Test batch operations
- Test with different device types (CPU/CUDA)
- Test flood penalty calculation specifically
- Test environmental flow penalty specifically
- Test the interaction between reward components

### 4. Performance and Coverage
- Add performance benchmarks
- Ensure test coverage > 90%
- Add property-based tests for invariants

## Implementation Plan

1. **Enhance existing test files** with missing edge cases
2. **Create integration test file** for TorchRL compatibility
3. **Add performance benchmarks**
4. **Run coverage analysis** and fill gaps
5. **Ensure all acceptance criteria are met**

## Acceptance Criteria Check
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code coverage > 90% for environment code
- [ ] Tests run in < 10 seconds
- [ ] Environment is validated for TorchRL compatibility
