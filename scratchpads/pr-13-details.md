# PR #13: Implement reservoir simulator and TorchRL environment

**URL**: https://github.com/CooperBigFoot/RL-demo/pull/13
**Status**: Draft
**Branch**: fix/issue-3-torchrl-environment
**Addresses**: Issues #2 and #3

## Summary
This PR implements both the basic reservoir simulator (issue #2) and the TorchRL environment wrapper (issue #3) in a single PR since #3 depends on #2.

## Key Components

### ReservoirSimulator (#2)
- Core water balance dynamics
- Seasonal inflow patterns with noise
- Safety constraints on releases
- 247 lines of tests with full coverage

### DiscreteReservoirEnv (#3)
- TorchRL-compatible wrapper with EnvBase
- 11 discrete actions (0-10% release)
- 13-dimensional observation space
- Multi-objective reward function
- 178 lines of tests

## Files Changed
- `src/rl_demo/envs/reservoir_simulator.py` (241 lines)
- `src/rl_demo/envs/discrete_reservoir_env.py` (274 lines)
- `tests/test_reservoir_simulator.py` (247 lines)
- `tests/test_discrete_reservoir_env.py` (178 lines)
- `examples/test_environment.py` (48 lines)
- Various `__init__.py` files updated

## Review Notes
- Reward function weights are hardcoded - may need tuning
- Using new `Composite` spec instead of deprecated `CompositeSpec`
- All tests passing (16 total)
