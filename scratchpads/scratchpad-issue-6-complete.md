# Issue #6: DQN Training Components - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully implemented and merged DQN training components for reinforcement learning agent.

## PR Details
- **PR #15**: https://github.com/CooperBigFoot/RL-demo/pull/15
- **Merged**: 2025-06-30T07:38:55Z
- **Merge Commit**: cc067a9
- **Merged By**: CooperBigFoot (Nicolas Lazaro)

## What Was Delivered
1. **Core Components** (`src/rl_demo/trainers/dqn_components.py`):
   - `create_dqn_loss()` - DQN loss module with smooth L1/L2 loss
   - `create_exploration_module()` - Epsilon-greedy exploration
   - `create_target_updater()` - Soft/hard target network updates
   - `create_replay_buffer()` - TensorDict replay buffer
   - `create_qvalue_actor()` - Q-value based action selection
   - `create_dqn_training_components()` - All-in-one convenience function

2. **Comprehensive Testing** (`tests/test_dqn_components.py`):
   - 16 unit tests covering all components
   - Integration tests verifying components work together
   - Device placement tests for GPU compatibility
   - All tests passing ✅

3. **Documentation** (`scratchpads/scratchpad-issue-6-plan.md`):
   - Implementation details and design decisions
   - Key learnings about tensor shapes
   - Usage examples

## Key Technical Achievements
- Proper TorchRL integration using QValueActor
- Correct tensor shape handling for replay buffer
- GPU-compatible implementation
- Clean, modular API design
- No regressions in existing tests

## Impact
These components provide the foundation for DQN agent training:
- Loss computation for Q-learning updates
- Exploration strategy for training
- Experience replay for stable learning
- Target network updates for convergence

## Next Steps
With these components merged, the project is ready for:
1. Implementing the main DQN training loop
2. Integrating with the reservoir environment
3. Running training experiments
4. Performance evaluation and tuning

## Lessons Learned
- TorchRL expects rewards/done flags with shape [1] not [] for batching
- QValueActor requires module as first positional argument
- TorchRL uses 'eps' parameter instead of 'tau' for soft updates
- Comprehensive testing early catches integration issues

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
Issue #6 has been successfully implemented, tested, and merged to main.
