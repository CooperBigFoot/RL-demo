# PR #12: Implement Basic Reservoir Simulator Class

## Summary
Created pull request #12 to implement the core reservoir simulation logic as requested in issue #2.

## PR Details
- **URL**: https://github.com/CooperBigFoot/RL-demo/pull/12
- **Branch**: fix/issue-2-reservoir-simulator
- **Title**: feat: Implement basic reservoir simulator class (#2)
- **Status**: Open

## Implementation Highlights
1. **ReservoirSimulator Class**: Core simulation logic with water balance equation
2. **Inflow Generation**: Sinusoidal pattern with seasonal variation and noise
3. **Safety Constraints**: Enforced limits on releases (dead storage, daily max)
4. **Comprehensive Tests**: 13 test cases with 100% functionality coverage
5. **Clean API**: Simple methods for reset, step, get_state, and is_safe

## Files Changed
- `src/rl_demo/envs/reservoir_simulator.py` (241 lines)
- `tests/test_reservoir_simulator.py` (247 lines)
- `scratchpads/issue-2-plan.md` (38 lines)
- Minor formatting fixes to __init__.py files

## Next Steps
1. Wait for code review
2. Address any feedback
3. Once merged, proceed with TorchRL wrapper implementation (likely issue #3)

## Notes
- The PR is slightly large (556 lines) but most of it is comprehensive test coverage
- All tests pass and linting issues resolved
- Implementation is standalone without TorchRL dependencies as requested
