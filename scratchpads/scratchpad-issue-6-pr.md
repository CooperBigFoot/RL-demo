# Pull Request #15: DQN Training Components

## PR Details
- **URL**: https://github.com/CooperBigFoot/RL-demo/pull/15
- **Title**: feat: Setup DQN loss and training components (#6)
- **Branch**: fix/issue-6-dqn-training-components
- **Status**: Open

## Summary
Successfully implemented all DQN training components as specified in issue #6:
- DQN loss module with TorchRL integration
- Epsilon-greedy exploration
- Target network updates
- Replay buffer
- Q-value actor
- Convenience function to create all components

## Key Technical Decisions
1. Used `QValueActor` directly instead of manual TensorDictModule wrapping
2. Ensured tensor shapes are correct for replay buffer (rewards/done need shape [1])
3. Followed TorchRL conventions (eps parameter for soft updates)
4. Added comprehensive test coverage (16 tests)

## Files Changed
- `src/rl_demo/trainers/dqn_components.py` (297 lines)
- `tests/test_dqn_components.py` (347 lines)
- `scratchpads/scratchpad-issue-6-plan.md` (64 lines)

## Next Steps
1. Wait for PR review and approval
2. Address any review feedback
3. Once merged, these components will be ready for integration in the DQN training loop
4. Future issues can build on these components to implement the full training pipeline

## Testing Summary
- All 16 new component tests passing
- All 56 total project tests passing
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Tested on CPU (GPU tests included but skipped if CUDA unavailable)
