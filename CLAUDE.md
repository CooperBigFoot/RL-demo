# Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

When analyzing large codebases (>50 files or >100KB total) that exceed context limits, or when prompted by the use to "use gemini", use `gemini -p` with Google Gemini's massive context window. Use `@` syntax for file inclusion: `@src/main.py` (single file), `@src/` (directory), `@./` (entire project), or `gemini --all_files -p "query"`. Paths are relative to current directory. Optimal for comprehensive security audits (`gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Complete security analysis with specific vulnerabilities and fixes"`), performance analysis (`gemini -p "@src/ @config/ Identify bottlenecks with optimization strategies"`), architecture assessment (`gemini -p "@src/ Analyze patterns and technical debt with actionable recommendations"`), and feature verification (`gemini -p "@src/feature/ @tests/ Verify implementation completeness with gap analysis"`). Always provide business context, request specific actionable recommendations with code examples, and ask for prioritized findings with effort estimates for maximum value.
