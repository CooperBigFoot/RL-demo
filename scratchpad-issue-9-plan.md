# Issue #9 Implementation Plan: Evaluation Script and Performance Metrics

## Objective
Create a comprehensive evaluation script (`scripts/evaluate_dqn.py`) to test trained DQN policies and compute performance metrics for reservoir control.

## Analysis of Requirements

### 1. Core Components Needed
- **Model Loading**: Load trained DQN models from checkpoints
- **Evaluation Loop**: Run multiple episodes (100) with deterministic policy
- **Metrics Collection**: Track detailed performance indicators
- **Baseline Policies**: Implement comparison policies
- **Report Generation**: Create visualizations and summary statistics

### 2. Key Performance Metrics
Based on the issue description and reservoir control objectives:
- **Average Episode Reward**: Overall performance indicator
- **Success Rate**: Episodes without floods or droughts
- **Hydropower Efficiency**: Average power generation
- **Environmental Flow Compliance**: Percentage of time environmental constraints met
- **Storage Variance**: Measure of operational stability
- **Flood Count**: Number of flood events across episodes
- **Drought Count**: Number of drought events across episodes
- **Action Distribution**: Analysis of action selection patterns

### 3. Baseline Policies to Implement
1. **Random Policy**: Uniform random action selection
2. **Conservative Policy**: Always release minimum (1% or environmental flow)
3. **Aggressive Policy**: Maximize hydropower (release based on demand)

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Evaluation Framework
1. Create main evaluation script structure
2. Implement checkpoint loading functionality
3. Set up evaluation loop with metrics collection

### Phase 2: Metrics Implementation
1. Define comprehensive metrics dictionary
2. Implement per-step and per-episode metric collection
3. Add flood/drought detection logic
4. Calculate environmental compliance rates

### Phase 3: Baseline Policies
1. Implement BaselinePolicy abstract class
2. Create RandomPolicy, ConservativePolicy, AggressivePolicy
3. Ensure compatibility with evaluation loop

### Phase 4: Visualization and Reporting
1. Generate summary statistics
2. Create episode trajectory plots
3. Visualize action distributions
4. Generate comparison tables

## Technical Details

### Checkpoint Loading
- Use same device as training (CPU/CUDA)
- Load Q-network architecture and weights
- Set model to evaluation mode

### Evaluation Loop Structure
```python
for episode in range(n_episodes):
    obs = env.reset()
    episode_metrics = initialize_episode_metrics()
    
    while not done:
        action = policy.get_action(obs, deterministic=True)
        next_obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        update_metrics(episode_metrics, obs, action, reward, info)
        obs = next_obs
    
    aggregate_metrics(total_metrics, episode_metrics)
```

### Key Considerations
1. **Deterministic Evaluation**: No exploration (epsilon=0)
2. **Statistical Significance**: Run 100 episodes for reliable metrics
3. **Fair Comparison**: Use same environment seed across policies
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Process metrics incrementally

## Expected Outputs
1. **Console Output**: Summary statistics table
2. **Plots**: 
   - Episode rewards over time
   - Storage level trajectories
   - Action distribution histogram
3. **JSON Report**: Detailed metrics for further analysis
4. **Comparison Table**: DQN vs baseline policies

## Success Criteria
- Script runs without errors on trained models
- Metrics provide meaningful insights
- Clear performance comparison with baselines
- Reproducible results with fixed seeds
